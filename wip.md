- app installer when accessed from web (/install) is ugly

- sample application!

Yet to be cleaned up and ported to stitches:

- rabbidtest and testing stuff in general
- Cache (disk cache implementation)
- Stock config editor
- Image/Imse image resizer
- Crypto::hash via phpcrypt
- tools/model-generator and basemodel
- tools/language-tool
- Language/localization helpers and translations

- simplereport table/report generator?
